Use this checklist to verify your Docker setup is complete and working.

## üì¶ **Files Created**

- [x] `backend/Dockerfile` - Backend container definition
- [x] `backend/.dockerignore` - Ignore unnecessary files
- [x] `frontend/Dockerfile` - Production frontend container
- [x] `frontend/Dockerfile.dev` - Development frontend container
- [x] `frontend/.dockerignore` - Frontend ignore files
- [x] `frontend/nginx.conf` - Nginx configuration
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` - Main orchestration file
- [x] `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development overrides
- [x] `.env.example` - Environment template
- [x] `Makefile` - Easy commands
- [x] `DOCKER_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- [x] `README.md` - Updated with Docker instructions

## üöÄ **Quick Verification**

### Step 1: Prerequisites ‚úÖ
```bash
# Check if Docker is installed and running
docker --version          # Should show version
docker-compose --version  # Should show version
docker info               # Should show Docker system info
```

### Step 2: Setup Environment ‚úÖ
```bash
# In the RSP_Education_App_V2 directory
ls -la .env.example       # File should exist
cp .env.example .env      # Copy template
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

### Step 3: Build and Start ‚úÖ
```bash
# Option 1: Using Make (Recommended)
make quick-start

# Option 2: Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 4: Verify Services ‚úÖ
```bash
# Frontend
curl -I http://localhost:3000    # Should return 200 OK

# Backend 
curl http://localhost:8000/health # Should return {"status":"healthy"}

# Database
docker-compose exec database pg_isready -U rsp_user -d rsp_education
```

### Step 5: Run Tests ‚úÖ
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds for services to fully start, then:
make test

# Expected: 6/6 tests passing (100% success rate)
```

## üåê **Application Access Points**

After successful setup, verify these URLs work:

- [ ] **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 *(Student/Parent Interface)*
- [ ] **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000 *(API Endpoints)*  
- [ ] **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs *(Interactive Documentation)*
- [ ] **Database Admin**: http://localhost:8080 *(Database Management)*
- [ ] **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health *(System Status)*

## üß™ **Functional Testing**

### Frontend Testing:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Registration form works
- [ ] Login form accepts credentials  
- [ ] Subject selection displays
- [ ] Topic selection works
- [ ] AI content generation functions

### Backend Testing:
- [ ] API documentation loads
- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Authentication endpoints work
- [ ] Content generation endpoints respond
- [ ] Database connections active

### Integration Testing:
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] AI content generation works from frontend
- [ ] Database stores user data correctly

## üõ†Ô∏è **Management Commands**

Verify these commands work:

### Essential Commands:
- [ ] `make help` - Shows command list
- [ ] `make up` - Starts all services  
- [ ] `make down` - Stops all services
- [ ] `make logs` - Shows logs from all services
- [ ] `make status` - Shows service status
- [ ] `make health` - Checks service health

### Development Commands:
- [ ] `make logs-backend` - Backend logs only
- [ ] `make logs-frontend` - Frontend logs only
- [ ] `make shell-backend` - Access backend container
- [ ] `make shell-db` - Access database shell

### Testing Commands:
- [ ] `make test` - Runs UAT tests
- [ ] `make test-backend` - Runs unit tests

## üîß **Troubleshooting Checklist**

If something isn't working:

### Port Conflicts:
- [ ] Check if ports 3000, 8000, 5432, 6379 are free
- [ ] Kill any processes using these ports
- [ ] Restart Docker Desktop

### Docker Issues:
- [ ] Docker Desktop is running
- [ ] Docker has enough resources (4GB RAM minimum)
- [ ] Docker disk space available (10GB minimum)

### Environment Issues:
- [ ] `.env` file exists and has API keys
- [ ] API keys are valid and working
- [ ] No extra spaces or quotes in .env values

### Service Issues:
- [ ] All containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Check logs for errors: `make logs`
- [ ] Try restarting: `make restart`

## üìà **Performance Verification**

### Resource Usage:
- [ ] Total RAM usage < 4GB
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable (<50% sustained)
- [ ] Disk usage acceptable
- [ ] No memory leaks over time

### Response Times:
- [ ] Frontend loads in <3 seconds
- [ ] Backend health check <1 second
- [ ] API responses <2 seconds
- [ ] AI content generation <30 seconds

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

Your setup is successful when:

- [ ] All services start without errors
- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] All application URLs are accessible  
- [ ] UAT tests show 6/6 passing
- [ ] You can register a student account
- [ ] You can generate AI educational content
- [ ] Database stores data correctly
- [ ] Services restart cleanly

## üéâ **Final Validation**

Run this complete validation:

```bash
# Start fresh
make down
make clean
make quick-start

# Wait 30 seconds, then test
sleep 30
make test
make health

# If everything shows green/OK, you're ready! üöÄ
```
